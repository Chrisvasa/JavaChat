# Tjatt-JPT

Tjatt-JPT is a simple Java Swing application that simulates a basic chat system.

### Currently working on:
- Rendering different panels depending on the users choices.
- Showing chat history between logins (At least a certain amount)
- Connecting the application to a database.
- Allowing for LAN connections.

## Features

- User authentication: Validates username and password.
- Simple GUI: Uses Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
- User tracking: Keeps track of online user activity.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Compile and run the `Chat.java` file.
3. Enter your username and password.
4. Click the "Login" button to log in.

## How it Works

Currently the program initializes a list of users with usernames and passwords. When you click the "Login" button, the program checks if the entered credentials match any of the predefined users. If a match is found, you'll see a "Login Successful!" message; otherwise, you'll see an "Invalid username or password!" message.
